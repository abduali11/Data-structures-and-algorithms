"Write a program that takes a positive integer, n, as input and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n."
"The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula:"

n = int (input())
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
print(f"The sum of the first {n} positive integers is {sum}")
